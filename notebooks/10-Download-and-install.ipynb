Its main purpose is to serve as a\ntestbed for semantic mapping algorithms through the categorization of objects\nand/or rooms.\n\nNevertheless, the Robot@Home dataset has been updated to Robot@Home2. This\nupdate is made up of a relational database file in SQLite format with all the\noriginal data and a size of only 2,2 GB. The image and scene files have been\nreorganized and now takes only 25,9 GB. You no longer need to waste time diving\nthe obscure data formats. Instead, you can simply surf the dataset through SQL\nqueries or the new toolbox. Nevertheless, a toolbox has been coded in order to\nencapsulate frequent queries as functions and integrate the results with a data\nanalysis library.
